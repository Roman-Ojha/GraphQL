*) What is GraphQL?
    -> GraphQL is a powerful query language use to communicate between client and server
    -> Allows for a more flexible and efficient approach than REST

EX:
    -> Endpoint for getting a particular book:
        domain.com/books/:id
            -> title, genre, reviews, author id
    
    -> now if we want to make a request using author id then we will make another request
    -> Endpoint for getting the author info of that book:
        -> domain.com/authors/:id
            -> name, age, biography, bookIDs

    -> if we are making the complex application in that case it would be slower to query 
# A GraphQL Approach....
    -> Query to get book data and it's author data(AND the other books):
        -> {
            book(id: 123){
                title
                genre
                reviews
                author{
                    name
                    bio
                    books{
                        name
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    -> here all of this is one request and all of that nested information can be able to get by one single http request
    -> we can also filter the only field that we want:
        -> {
            book(id: 123){
                title
                author{
                    name
                    bio
                    books{
                        name
                    }
                }
            }
        }
