=> First we will create a model

*) Install Graphene
=> To make working of graphql in Python we will use package 'graphene-django'
    -> https://pypi.org/project/graphene-django/
    -> pip install graphene-django
    -> on settings.py:
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            # ...
            'graphene_django',
        ]

        GRAPHENE = {
            'SCHEMA': 'myapp.schema.schema'
        }
        
-> now we will create schema on './books/schema.py'
-> now we will create urls to access the GraphQL
